  ## Installation
  
  This program requires that Node.js is installed. Then run 'npm i' to install the necessary dependencies.
  
  ## Usage 
  
  Navigate to the db folder within the application. Sign into your MySql user name by running 'mysql -u root -p" (replace root if using a different user). Initiate the database by running "SOURCE schema.sql". You can now navigate back to the root folder. Here you can choose to seed the database by running "npm run seed" or you can skip ahead to start the program. Run "npm run start" to initiate the program.
